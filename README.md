# sass-spa CSS Based Single Page App

The goal of the project is to achieve a single page application type of behavior without any javascript usage.

There's no webpack usage either. All work is done with VS code extension [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) and Live Server

CSS based AI included 😉

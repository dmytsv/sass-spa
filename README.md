Currently is in beta version 0.1.x

The goal of the project is to achieve a single page application type of behavior without any javascript usage.

There's no webpack usage either. All work is done with VS code extension [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) and Live Server
